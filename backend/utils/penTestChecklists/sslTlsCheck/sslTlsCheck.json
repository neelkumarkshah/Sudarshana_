    {
      "Vulnerability": "Weak Cipher Suite",
      "Description": "Weak cipher suites are encryption algorithms that are no longer considered secure. They can be exploited by attackers to decrypt or tamper with data in transit. Using weak cipher suites makes it easier for attackers to perform man-in-the-middle attacks or decrypt sensitive data.",
      "Severity": "High",
      "Remediation": "Disable weak cipher suites and ensure that only strong, up-to-date encryption algorithms are enabled. Common weak cipher suites include those using DES or RC4. Refer to the latest guidelines for cipher suite recommendations and configure your server to use only strong cipher suites.",

      "Vulnerability": "Expired or Invalid SSL/TLS Certificate",
      "Description": "An expired or invalid SSL/TLS certificate can compromise the security of encrypted communications. Expired certificates can cause browsers to display warnings, and invalid certificates may not properly establish trust with clients.",
      "Severity": "High",
      "Remediation": "Regularly monitor and renew SSL/TLS certificates before they expire. Ensure that certificates are properly issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) and verify their validity using online tools or certificate management systems.",

    {
      "Vulnerability": "Insecure SSL/TLS Protocol Version",
      "Description": "Using outdated or insecure SSL/TLS protocol versions can expose your server to vulnerabilities. Protocols like SSLv2 and SSLv3 are considered obsolete and have known security flaws. Modern TLS versions should be used to ensure the security of data in transit.",
      "Severity": "High",
      "Remediation": "Disable outdated SSL/TLS protocol versions and configure your server to support only secure versions such as TLS 1.2 or TLS 1.3. Regularly update your server and client configurations to adhere to current security best practices.",
